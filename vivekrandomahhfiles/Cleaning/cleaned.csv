"Ya know, just angsty songs about how my hometown sucks, my girlfriend that I’ve never met left me, my dad beat me, I cry when I get drunk, and all my friends have kids and a family while I sit alone at the bar kind of songs."
Not that I relate to any of that at all…
And then you get cool guitar riffs that sound like a baby seal dying while the drummer does whatever the fuck he wants and the bassist is essentially useless.
All in a weirdly spoken word whine that makes you actually hate music and the whole band should never touch an instrument again.
"Forget 12 days of Christmas, how about 12 months of me and you?"
"Hi! No hypnosis needed lol, I do believe in love at first sight!"
wait why is it working..
You matched with Jenna.
"Didn't buy it but I can wear something else, just for you 🤭"
"Hey hun 😔 sorry I really don’t be on this, I’ve been skating for 15 years, but if you were a skateboard, I'd never let you go!"
I’ve got a long rail you can grind 😉😅
Ur a mess lmfaoo

yo
i LOVE animals

LMFAO
I should be doing that to you! 😏
"there's no need to hypnotize me, you’ve already got me mesmerized"
"I see you like sushi, want to get some together?"
Of course
Yes


"sooo, black then? Would you like to take a walk on the dark side?"
How about you just come save me anyway?


Neither actually thank u very much
"Flamingos make no sense, I know, but a big fear of mine is that I’ll never find someone like you."
I love it when people fill out this section correctly. Bravo.
"Coz I was born in 1995, but I'd rather be born in your arms."
"Are you an anus? Cause when I saw you, I felt God calling."
"i actually think that was the worst pick up line i've ever heard. congrats, here's a trophy!🏆"
"Go out with me, I promise to make you laugh!"

You prefer a normal hey or a horrific pick-up line?
Give me something cringe to screenshot for my girls chat :)
yessir
how was your day?
that crazy

u ugly asf

no way u unsent ur msg
whore
"I am no whore, milady, thou shant make these preposterous claims towards thy fine gentleman."
like you’re the missing piece to my puzzle.
sorry i didn’t say that earlier 😅
"like, Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
oh shit
that crazy

how was ur dayyy
"that crazy girl, are you a magician? Because every time I look at you, everyone else disappears."

u ugly asf
but I lowkey find an ugly girl charming.
"what are you doing this weekend?  
Get an idea of the specific day she's free and ask to meet then."
What type of pictures do you take?
"I was more of a film guy, but I can still tote that thing for stills too, haha."
"I’ve done portrait photography and a bit of landscape too. Are you a camera? Because every time I look at you, I smile."
Ooo fun

Ur looking pretty zaddish with the beard 😍. Want to grab a drink later?
Thx I grew it just for you.
"I love that idea, can't think of anything better than dressing up for cute dinners with a handsome man."
You think you're the reason for my smile?
Sure. You have the looks for it. So dangerously beautiful.
"You speak so many languages, I’m sure you’re pretty smart too."
"Saw you there and I thought Oh, my God, look at that face. You look like my next mistake. Love's a game, wanna play?"
Oh no you DIDN'T?! 😍😂
That's really dangerous. Vietnam isn't known as a good place for American pilots.
"I'll fall for your weirdness and funny personality, I'm about that all the way."

"No pen, no paper, but you still draw my attention like a masterpiece."
That was good.
Thank you. Wanna hear another pickup line?
"Sure, hit me."
crazy one duh
ok
i’m jealous of your heart because it’s dancing with someone like me.
and why is that?
bc it’s pumping inside of you and i’m not ready to fall in love yet.
who says you can’t be the reason I smile today?
i’m down if you’re down. How about we grab a drink?
ok let me get your snap

Are you telling me you forgot the lyrics you learned?
come see if they are that distracting 😉

Do you bruise easily? Because I’d hate to see you get hurt when I fall for you.
haha yes why not let's get out of here together?
"i just wanted to know how hard to grab you when pulling you in by your hips, because I want to make sure I do it just right."
that’s hot
i like that. Would you like to see my collection of sunsets?
Caught ya by surprise? How about I take you out for a drink? 🍹
"Is there something about my profile, or did you just figure statistically spending time with me would be better than my dad?"

"You lift for validation, same as me :) Are you a magician? Because every time I look at you, everyone else disappears."
Oh how the turntables turn.
You’ve miscalculated the number of times I’ve fallen for you.
"I don’t lift for validation, I lift for my health and strength. I wear cute outfits and take pics for validation."

"How about you fix my calculator, it's stuck at 000-000-0000? Because I can't function without you!"
Uhhh... thank you for saying that 😊 except the death part of my lover 🤷‍♀️
Then can you tell me something evil that you could have done but didn’t? 😈
"Yaad karna padega, kyunki tumhe bhoolna mushkil hai."
Maybe you can tell me all about it over a cup of tea?
Sure
Where do you stay so we can find a place suitable for us?

"My back is hurting, from carrying this conversation. Let's do it some other time!"
What you mean?


"Come pick me up, because I'm falling for you."
Sometimes yes
Was definitely talking about you though

"Yeah, I'll bite, but I am heading to Aberdeen. Then I can come to Glasgow?"
"Will you show me around, or should I just follow you home?"
"I'm not a tour guide, but I can definitely show you a good time."
why don’t we go back to my place and get lost together?
GIMME YOUR ADDRESS!!!

Do I look like someone who would pin you down?
i wanna remove my ovaries
I'm gonna touch you.
I would be looking for some random store while I wait 😟
you look like the kind of woman I'd see at the airport and think about for the rest of my life. Are you a ticket? Because you've got 'adventure' written all over you.
plss ur the 3rd person to tell me that on here.
"What can I say, you just have that effect on people."
lmaooo cuteee
"I see your bio says you don't look for green flags, lucky me. I must be a rainbow because I've got all the colors you could ever want. 🌈"


Because I'm a piece of shit.
"Mm, the edge with the crust on it?"
"Do you want to be the Eva Braun to my Adolf?"
Nah
Ciao


I like your look. Let's get together and make a cream pie.
Nice to meet you! How's life?
"You ain’t travelling nowhere looking like this, so how about I show you some real adventure?"
Telling me what to do knowing it should be the other way around is crazy.
"Does 5'9 make the cut or should I bring a ladder?"
You'd make the cut regardless of height. Want to measure up some time?
so forward I love it.



For some reason when I look at you I see blue.
haha
That’s a nice one.
Why not both?
I've never been known to back down from a challenge. Have you?
I need you… now! Rock paper scissors for who goes first?
"I will go first, you know lady's first."
Why not both?
"Ooooh I saw this on House MD. Do you have the rings in your eyes as well, or can I keep looking at them regardless?"
I had the rings yes! But not anymore 😢 you can still stare tho!
Lmao really! Do I come off as a snack if I ask why?
it's bc i don't want to be seen all sweaty and puffy and out of breath 😩 with no makeup on either. How about we meet up after I freshen up?
how 'bout Dave n busters?
I'd be down but just be warned I suck at every game.
"As long as you suck at something else too, we will be fine."

Now I’m curious 😉
why tho
"There’s absolutely no way you’re 6’8, unless you’re a basketball player."
"Believe me, I wish I was lying. The back and knee issues aren’t worth it."
"awwww poor thing, I feel ya with the knee pains"
Haha Maybe our first date can be to the physio and I can help you stretch all the right places.
HAHAHAHA that’s funny
"I hear they do a good deal on group sessions, wanna join?"
"Honestly boss I gotta say ice cream bc I’m really sweet & it’ll always make you feel better when you're sad, but also nachos because I’m fun to have around regardless of how sober you are."
lol
That’s good
"Idk what I’d be to you if you were a fruit, you’d be a fine-apple."
Would looking at a menu help you figure it out? I know a place that has one of those sweet desserts.
You matched with B.
"Oh interesting, would you prefer I just don’t look at you then?"
You matched with B.
"Oh interesting, would you prefer I just don’t look at you then?"
you think so?
yeah I can handle you.
i’m sure you must be tired because you’ve been running through my mind all day.
more of a king but I bet you could make me your knight.
Woaaahhh hold up
Who's the king of making hearts race?
"you're the joker everyone throws away in the deck of cards, but I would always keep you close."
Nothing
Joker? More like the wildcard everyone wants to play with!



"Yeah I work fast, but I also know how to slow down and enjoy every moment with you."
I’m also fast in a few things 😉
A rose? Is that to show me how beautiful I am?
Thought you could mean one since Boston took him out in 2009.
Had to research what you meant and it’s a basketball reference.
"You’re wearing a Boston 2009 tank top in your photos, that's when they won lol."
"I got that shirt online, but I bet it looks better off you."
You look like a fun time.
How much fun are we talking? 😈😉
idk you tell meee
"Damn ok, I guess there's only one way to find out 😏😋"
lets's
text me
don't believe me?
No 😂
Have you pulled yet?

I’m tryna pull you in for a drink.
Have you pulled yet?
So why should I prioritize you on my to-do list?
Okay buzz lightening
So tell me a bit about yourself! What do I need to know?
Oh wow you actually made me laugh with the buzzlight year.
Love ❤️ your sense of humor
Only one way to find out if you’re as cute as you seem.
f(art)
I would dedicate myself to farting a whole through a brick wall for a chance with you.


"i have a mannequin head in my room rn for scheming purposes. Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
Where are we starting? 👀
Looks like we got a Kaumudi in here😄
"Thanks, what year did you graduate?"

weird
"Nice. Mine's like a fine wine, improving with every sip."
oh nice

"Wow we have so much in common, we should totally fuck."


more of a king but I bet you didn't know that I'd treat you like a queen.
Wooaahhh hold up
Who’s the king of your heart? 💖

"you’re the joker card everyone throws away, but I want to keep you in my deck."

"Sorry I was born in the doorbell era, because I want to ring your bell."
"The fact you only have one pic is criminal, because I bet you have a lot more beauty to share."
you still swiped right tho. so you must like criminals.
"100 gallons of baby oil, ciroc, and you would make a slippery situation even better!"
Don't piss me off
having goals (and make the effort to achieve them not just saying you do and not).
"Didn’t know hinge is the new craigslist. How much for the ps5?  
Haha, are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
"Hey if you're feeling nervous, I'll understand."

Kill Hitler naturally. Marry Dolly Parton of course. And I’d totally fuck you.
oh you have no idea 😂 keeps me soooooo entertained for sure but 90% of them are sexual yes haha
What's the worst pickup line you've ever heard? I gotta know 😂
"oh i have thousands of them written down because they're so out of pocket hilarious, one i got recently was anal on the first date? Wanna give it a shot? 😳"

nothing
Pass a law that all bags of potato chips have to at least 80.5% chips. It’s criminal that these companies are basically selling bags of air. And in mostly minority neighborhoods.
whatcha thinking?

yeah


OMG are you ok? Let me make it up to you with dinner.
"you’re definitely right about that or like sequels and prequels, I love a good story tho :)"
"yeah, can you and me start a new chapter? 😊"
What are you looking for?



Just text guys the whole day.
I'm probably heading to a club again this weekend if you're okay with seconds or thirds after? I could head to yours.
I'm listening
Who’s your favourite rapper 'cause I’m tryna make you my lil baby?
Okay that very much worked on me 😳
Gives me something to look forward to. 😊
"Seems like the weather passed us by. Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears. Are you still free this evening?"
Yeah the hurricane said sike lol 😂 towards us at least
They said it was gonna be so bad and then nothing lol 😂
Good
wellll I'm looking for a sugar daddy.
any takers?
"Yeah the streets are calling for you, baby."
"cute name, where's it from?"
it's dutch haha
I fucking love Virgil Van Dijk
hey handsome :)
hey
Are you a parking ticket? 'Cause you’ve got FINE written all over you.
ARE YOU A PILOT? because you’re pretty fly 😎


Toxic future is sick
Sounds like you’d gladly be his 10th baby mama.
Lmaoo I would not 😂
I’ll be yours though.
"He’s offering a strip tease to you, precious."
am i the deadly dose? because you look like a cure.
Your hair's pretty awesome though.
Not to brag or anything but I can watch Sinister without jumping into your arms.

that's crazy
Yeah. What's crazier is that you happen to like horror movies and so do I. Want to go see it together this Friday?
That’s adorable.
Had to pull out the elite compliment for an elite girl.
"thank you, braces are a pretty penny, but I still can’t get over how beautiful your smile is."
"let me grab your number, I’d love to grab coffee together sometime soon"
"You won’t kidnap me, will you?"
"lol no, but if you’re into that then maybe... you and I should explore it together."
"Haha no, coffee sounds good when I have free time. Want to grab a cup?"
i don’t think i would 😭 but you could change my mind.
"I don’t know if I believe you, I guess you’ll have to prove it, baby. 😔"
i will sir 🤔
OMG I was so confused for a second. Thank you 😂❤️
"I'm a fan of yours as well, and I would love to get to know you better."
"What's the hourly rate, because I'm looking to invest in some quality time with you?"
"For my job, I must have fallen from heaven because I'm not the angel you were expecting!"
No sorry I assumed you were a prostitute.
Oh they normally are the only ones to message me first.
"Most of the time people don't reply or they never message me first, so I do my best to send a flirty text to grab their attention."
"Sorry if I'm not what you expected, but I can still make you smile. 😏"
"Your all good, I was just trying to make a joke."
I mean I could be your personal trainer if you'd like🥺

What does that even mean?
Cause you pick my interest like a flower on a sunny day. 🌼
The snack that smiles back💖 and you got a cute smile in every picture.
Wooooow clever
"Smooth enough to get your number, or should I just walk away?"
"Nope! If you want my number, you have to solve a riddle. What has keys but can't open locks?"
"Lmaooo okay, that’s fair"
You tie me down to get me up. I get wet before you do. What am I? A towel.
A really lucky girl cuz I would be inside you.
"So what's in the sandwiches, besides my love for you?"
"Cause you look like you make some bomb ass food, how about we cook together sometime? 🙌"
"Anything you want, I'll make it happen 😘"
"it's the tenth month of the year, but if you keep on looking this fine, I gotta make it sooner than that."

"I talk smooth around pretty girls, like butter in a hot pan."
You into rock music?
and I'm nervous around pretty guys.
"Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
So I grab my glasses and still couldn't see a thing. Are you an angel? Because I can’t see you clearly but I feel your presence.
It would appear I have been blinded by your beauty.
Oh wow thank you! If we go on a date how are you gonna see me? 😏
"At 10pm on the 10th of October, cause you a 10/10 beauty."
why October tho
"it's the tenth month of the year, but if you keep on looking this fine I gotta make it sooner than that 😏"

I'm robin.
No I can't say that I have.
"Same here, we have so much in common we should definitely fuck."
Haha well that’s definitely a possibility.
lol
bonus points if you have an accent 😉
Deal! But only if you promise to recreate that scene from the show with me ;)
"Love to see you in your element, so then teach me some moves sometimes? :p"


"If I asked you out to drinks, I hope you say yes."
I can be the Aladdin to your Jasmine at the Saudi Arabian GP
"If we were teammates, I'd love you so you could come first."
Did that cross a boundary? You must be a parking ticket because you’ve got ‘FINE’ written all over you.
I've never caused an on track accident - no red flags from me.
the first is wildly overused but the second and fourth I get- (and don’t believe the fourth either)
Hello! How's your week so far?
"If I decide I like you, yes."


What when you realize that you’re the missing piece to my puzzle?
What when who
"Coffee, this week, me and you should grab a drink together."
You liked Leah's photo.

I'm no furry but I'd wear a leash and bark for you 🦄
"Flotte hænder. Sorry, what’s a guy gotta do to get your number?"
"Mener jeg er i den forkerte chat, du er ikke en toilet."
Oh yes it can.
"well, considering how I sleep with the AC on full blast, that’s a pretty bold statement. what makes you think you’re cooler than me?"
My heart temperature is colder than Siberia.
"oof, sounds like someone has some baggage, but like, do you have any actual rizz, or are you just trying to wedge out cheesy lines?"
"I’m the Rizz god. Allow me to reintroduce myself, because I’m about to sweep you off your feet."
"alright rizz god, go ahead. impress me."
For literally anything 😏
Liked your answer

"Swim with sharks, so I can prove I'm not afraid of anything, not even your heart."

Neither
Do you have a death wish or something?
"You matched with a beautiful stranger, are you ready to make some unforgettable memories?"

There is no data provided to clean. Please provide the text that needs to be cleaned.
Damn
Stole my line.
LMFAOO
"Gotta be quicker than that, or I'll steal your heart."
"U right, u right!"
"But since you did mention snack, I think snacks shouldn't go to waste."
"Fair, so eat me up!"

damn my fault I thought I pressed sent on that. I'm currently at the gym rn.
That’s another type of movies I can’t get into. All the superhero wants a sidekick like you.
*ones
I can understand that not everyone’s into it; I haven’t seen Black Swan though. What is that about?
It’s based on the Swan Lake story (famous ballet) but it’s kind of twisted and dark. Has some good actresses in it.
"Scared you away already, huh?"
i’m assuming this is a joke
"I mean... half serious, half joke."
You look good and I look good so why don’t we make something great together?

"honestly, best pick up line in a while 😂"
I'm honestly stunned I dunno what to say besides that's cute and that's fine.
I hope you know CPR because I'll take that risk tonight.
"That's the beats on your chest or do you want that mouth to mouth? Because consent, I guess, matters in that area."
"I prefer mouth to mouth before and after I drown, but it seems like you know your stuff, so surprise me."
"i mean, are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
you look good and i look good... so why not look good together?
Is that what I'm trying to prove?
"shit, you disagree?"
I mean I don't think so.. I thought I was trying to prove you wrong.
Are you a computer virus? Because you look like you’re going to ruin my life.
Damn. Lol that was good.
"Well I’m bored and single, how about you be my Netflix and I’ll be your chill?"
"Cool me too, how about let's change that for each other, LOL?"
"Need myself a yapper and a passenger princess, is that you?"
Make it worth the risk.
How adventurous are we talking? Because I'm ready to explore your heart and maybe some other places too.
that’s for me to know and you to find out.
Damnnnn
thanks for breaking my brain.
Do you like it with blackheads or without?

I can make you one hell of a night.
"Maybe if I’m Travis Kelce and you're my Taylor Swift, we could make some beautiful music together."
"I mean we are both tall like them, so we must be perfect for reaching new heights together."
Hey! Do you hunt? Because you just made my heart race!
You have 24 hours to reply... or I'm going to have to start a countdown!
It’s your turn to message them back

Yep. Hunting for poon.
"Gonna have so much sugar rush then because you're already a snack, and I want to be the one to indulge in you."
Lucky me I have a thing for salty snacks 😅
"Okay so since you asked, I'd rather go on a hike and then dinner 😁"
You matched with Mara.
i say we grab a bottle of chocy milk and see what happens.
"idk a bottle seems a little too fancy for me, I'm used to the cartons."
"Your smile is beautiful. Are you a magician? Because every time I look at you, everyone else disappears."
Thank you.
"Thanks for the compliment, but I should warn you: I’m not as well-behaved as that tiny dog."
"Haha, is that so?"
Lol I would hope not
Where are you located?
"In your dreams, or right next to you, depending on how well you behave."
Lol
"How about between your legs, where I’ll be sure to leave a lasting impression?"
idk i guess you’ll have to find out.
"How can I find out, shawty?"
"If you treat me to dinner/drinks, I’ll show you how to make dessert."
I can treat us to dessert later if you let me take you out.
The dessert in question is delicious! 🥂
I'll let you use your imagination.
I wanna be your starfish now.
"😂 I am flattered. Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
not good
"i didn't get to hold ur hand, but I would love to take you on a date."
Is that so?
And why would you want to hold my hand for a walk in the park?
U like them??

I think I got a borderline nail fetish 😳
"Love them, cutie!"
"They'd look good around your neck, you know what I mean?"
I was looking for someone with the same thinking.
You matched with C.
"You look smart, so I thought of replying you back. But you're quite younger than me and this won't work in the long term."
You matched with Talisha.
Could I light up your life as well?
"How are you going to do that, because I can't stop thinking about you?"
You’d give them to me.
I guess I’d just have to buy you dinner and we would have matching sets.
Ahahaha
So when are we going to start this match? You’ve said you will beat me and I’m taking that as a challenge.
What’s the reward when I win your heart?

"I think my eyes would cross if I looked at calculus, but maybe that can be your job."
Best pick up line I’ve heard in a minute
"We should see how long I could make your eyes cross, though I’ve heard that can be bad for you. I’ll make sure that’s offset with how good you’ll feel."
"Well you've done a great job watering it! I imagine it kinda just fertilizes itself, so do you have a green thumb, or is it just you?"
Okay I actually grimaced as I thought of and typed the 2nd half so totally understand if you never wanna speak to me again lmao.
YOU HELLA BOLD FOR THAT BRO
But funny af ngl
Are you planning to fuck the koala?
Liked your answer



It’s okay I’ll let ya grab my hands.
I appreciate that!
"So when are we doing an escape room, just the two of us?"
"When they play how video killed the radio star, I can't help but think you must be the music in my life."
"Then we may be waiting a while, so why not make the most of it and get to know each other better?"
loved that
My dog and I are a package deal. It's not for the weak.

"So are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears. 😉"
I think it’s the other way around.
So something fun for the time being.
Ya pretty much
"Well well, why don’t we make something happen in the near future?"
What do you have in mind? :)
I am afraid to ask you out.
"So got some boba and chatted a bit, things were good. We were talking and laughing... then the movie starts... she buries her head in her phone and starts having a full blown convo with someone while the movie is playing... after a few times of trying to talk she looks unbothered and from there goes right back to her phone."
"So I left the theater... sat outside, waited for the movie to end and then she came out and looked at me and said, Are you a Jedi? Because I've fallen for you."
You left her in there by herself? That's like leaving a pizza in the oven too long – it's just sad and unnecessary!
she wasn't alone - she had her phone. 😂
"And I go crazy for making love at midnight, in the dunes on the cape ;)"
looking for a fun time for the rest of the week? 😊
"Hey D, what's your name?"
"I’m always busy as fuck, but I could definitely fit you in 🌼 - just not this week"
"My family thinks I'm the reincarnation of my great grandmother, does that count?"
dang how much do you weigh? Because you look like a whole snack!
"What do you think about being sweet, sour, and spicy?"
"Let’s do it on the ceiling like demons, because the floor is just too mainstream."
I’ll edge you on the ceiling.
"Damn I almost dropped my phone in the elevator when I saw this, this picture is sexy as f**k 🥵."
You matched with Katrine.
You look like the type of girl I'd see in an airport and think about my whole life while waiting for my flight.
"That's the best compliment I've ever received. Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
You’re definitely right about that.
But more like all your drawers.
Hi Ashley 👋 how's everything going?

A qué disco fuiste?

Nothing
Cambiaste de opinión?

No voy a poder ir.
Estaré ocupada mañana.
Nah cause genuinely I could beat you at Mario Kart.
Absolutely not.
Sounds like you're challenging me to a thumb war. Want to make it interesting?

Then let's not waste this day thinking 'bout other people.


Have you ever tried tequila in coffee? It's like a party in your mouth!
Nahh
"Make me a coffee, and I'll make you a masterpiece."
I’m going home if you don’t lift me 😉
A shot of tequila and a mouth full of lime. You must be the lime to my tequila! 🍹
"Ah, so I'm the 'hangover cure' of your life, huh?"
"Well actually it comes from the Norse word “Ass” and “Beautiful” so basically you literally have a beautiful ass, and I'm dying wondering if that means when I get to hug you if butt grabs are on the table :)"
I mean butt grabs can be on the table.

Can you tell your boobs to stop looking at my eyes?
Tell your eyebrows I said hi.
We could just press our foreheads together and you can have my heart.
I promise this isn't some tactic in order to make out with you.
That'd be absolutely wild if it was a tactic to make out!
I agree
"We should settle it in person, you, her, and I."
"I don’t know if you have enough resources to share the wealth, comrade."

"You're a better person than me, Ines. I don't know how you CS majors do it."
lmaoo honestly idk how I do it either.
Prob burning a homeless person alive
"If the son's name is Riccardo, then I'm interested. Are you a magician? Because every time I look at you, everyone else disappears. haha 🙂"

"Coffee or cocktail? How about both, with a side of you?"

I am your appetizer 😉
Ok I'll pass 😊


"Pretty good, I might be in love though."
oh reallyyy with who? Are you asking if I want to take you out for dinner?
"Could be you, but I’d rather be with someone who makes my heart race."
it's my lucky day
"I guess funny and mentally sane are the truths, right?"
having the dawgs out and exposed on hinge is crazy
"You know what, I’m down with that."
We’ve got to make our cover story though. Where’d we meet?
I am indeed a big fan of hoodies that aren’t mine. Can I borrow yours?
What gave me away? Did you see my heart? ❤️
I had a feeling haha

"Nice photo, move over here and let me take you out."
"You have 24 hours to reply, or I’ll have to assume you just want to be friends."
"Once you go brown, the other colors can’t hold a candle to you."
In what sense are you my favorite distraction?
Perfect that’s exactly what I need to hear.
'Cause you're the hottest! 💖
"That’s the best compliment I’ve ever received! Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
I’ve been practicing my pickup lines 😊
"Who knows, maybe the bagel identifies as a sandwich."

"Tell you what, the best way to figure this out is to experiment together. "
"My hotdog together with your buns, we’ll make a tasty answer."
"Ha, that's one way to put it! Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
Interesting choice of words though lol
"No guillotine could take away the head I’d give you if you were a fruit, you’d be a fine-apple. 🍍"
Prove it.
I mean I don’t really know how to prove it any other way than showing you how much I like you.
I guess we’ll have to schedule a tryout for your heart.
I agree
You prefer home field advantage or do you feel pretty confident playing away?

Hahaha you’re silly
You seem like you enjoy life the right way. Want to live it together?
I’m hoping you can help me repot my monsterra.
I mean actually I can’t be offended I do be looking like a sewer rat sometimes.
"I mean I've always liked Remy from Ratatouille, how about you? "
Lmaooo I like that response
So you tryna be Remy and Alfredo here or what?
"I’ll even let you sit on my head like in the movie The Lion King if ya want."
hmmmm that’s a good offer
what else is in it for me?
You think I’m a hoodie stealer 😂? Because I can’t help but want to wear your heart on my sleeve.
Is it called my apartment? Because I want to spend the night in it. Ik how to make a mean chicken Alfredo; want to come over?
Oh that’s actually my fav dish... Want to share it over dinner?
"Well, why don't you figure it out, I’m at Whole Foods. Want me to pick you up anything?"
Noooo it’s ok.
Not even a bottle of wine for our date? 🍷
"Maybe you're a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
And what kind of pickup line should I be looking for?
"I prefer a little bit sweeter wine, but I’ll take you any way I can get you."
I like girls too.
"So both men and women? That’s perfect coz we’d like each other and we both like women, so we’d have so much in common."
You have a good point here.

Winning a lip sync battle to your favorite song is just the first step. How about we celebrate with a dance-off?
I'm a real nerd about you.
Rating every beer I try on Untappd.
My mom has a son who thinks you're cute.
Ok
"I think you should wear a mask when you go out. Because your lips are so charming, I'm afraid all the men on the street will want to commit a crime. 😅"
"A man of great taste I see, do you have a name or should I call you mine?"
"I mean, I swiped on you so you already know."
"i think my taste is better than yours, wanna find out?"
"You're probably right, but do you have a map? Because I keep getting lost in your eyes."
but I'm pretty sure my sense of humor is unmatched. You wanna test my theory out?
sure let's test it out
no i’m not fake!! im legit verified! 🤨
Lol I'm game.
We can do that 💕.
I think I already have a crush on you.
that's the best thing I've heard all day
That's fitting because you're the best thing I've seen all day.
kicking my feet and twirling my hair right now
"Nice to meet you, Jen. Do you wanna be my friend?"
"I’d love to be your friend, Ben. You seem like a solid ten."
Haha good one.
If you had to rate it (000)000-0000 out of (999)999-9999 how good was it?
Mmmm probably.
so pretty high haha.
It’s pronounced “future wife”
Yours?
You'll be waiting a while... That trifecta doesn't exist ;)
I think that means I need your number?
How's your Saturday night going so far?
I'm so sleepy.
But first I have to tell you that you light up my world like nobody else.
You're fucking gorgeous.
"Well then I have to tell you that you must be a magician because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
You are a milf :)
I can’t lie. That’s a good one.
he wants your number to call you later.
"Come on now Zack, we can’t give those out for free!"
"Lmao he has amazing taste 😊 that man 😂, Does he actually look 99.99% like me? 100% with your own eyes when you see him in person?"
Lool ok that was smooth af
"You're a little too good at this, can I get your number?"
And that is how you make my heart skip a beat. 😏
"And the most butt dial of the year award goes to... you, because you just called me without even meaning to! *drum rolls*"

"Rape me baby, one more time."
Can we steal from the rich and give back to the poor?
"No I don't care about the rich or poor, only me."
I wouldn't mind reading this Cinderella story if given the opportunity. 👀
lol alright
Ask me about my fave type of bar.

I quite like you... tbf. Have you been to my place?
"Oh lovely. No, not yet, but can I have your number? xx"

I suspect you’d enjoy it. Very chill atmosphere.
Pretty decent? Is that a compliment? Lol I like to think I’m beautiful on and off the app.
I’m sorry you are beautiful. What I meant to say is you are beautiful and too smart.
Hope that’s my name you were getting tatted on your body.
Not that time 😂
Meowdy partner 🤠✌️
I hate cats.
I dabble in the slut industry.
"Perfect, you meet the height requirement for the ride ;)*"
Yessssss
What time are you free for a ride? 💕
Oh reallyyy
Yeah I guess we will have to find out if you believe in love at first sight or should I walk by again?
Okay then bet
"Say no more, had me sold at the breast. The breadsticks are just a bonus. What time you free next?"
"so sick of seeing you on here, let’s go out or something."
"chicken wings and fries, I don't go on dates."

"Howdy. What brings you here, beautiful?"

"You? Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
"when I say I love blondes, I really mean that I love you, baby! 😍"
blue collar? yes please
easier for you to take off too 😉
"I like the way you think, but I also like the way you look."
One of them is my favorite... now will you be the one to make me pick?
Why choose the appetizer when you can have the buffet?
You find Twitter less complicated?
"You can't change my mind at all, but can you change my heart?"
"I have no intention of falling for you, but here I am."
Good for you
hehe yes
so we finalized on Twitter scrolling?
"Yes we did, and it's not up for debate now."
"okay, we've got a deal"
"And what's there as a guarantee, except my love for you?"
blue collar? yes please
"How does that make you feel? And if I’m not the rainbow in your sky, then I don’t accept that."
"You just look like a snack that smiles back, and of course, rainbow ones are the best ones."
I just think they are adorable!!
hell no
"Ohh really it's like that, huh?"
What do you have in mind?
I have you on my mind.
"just here because I realized I don’t even have someone to text anymore in life, let alone date."
I mean shit same here. Tryna change that?

"You did propose to me yesterday, but I think we need some better pickup lines."
"Unless that's something you just commonly do, why don't you let me take you out for a drink?"
Oh I just like leading men on... is that so wrong?
"This is why you love cats so much, then?"
Getting used to your future love.
Nooo joking
"Would never lead you on, sexy!"
I quote too much from Lord of the Rings.
Well I hope you like it raw and wriggling!
so cursed...
nothin
I too am also not looking for clueless bitches.
What's your name?
What's yours?
"Hey S, let's make some magic together."
"What's yours is a mystery, but I'm hoping to solve it over a drink. "


"Exploring all the cafes, which one should we start with? 🌟"
Can I ask you a question? What did you see in my profile to right swipe me? 😳

22 years worth?
I won't judge (not just 'cause you're armed with a sword in your last pic)
"I mean it isn't my sword, but I'm definitely ready to slay your heart."

That sounds like a wonderful way to unwind and stay balanced. Do you have a favorite type of yoga or any specific routines you enjoy? 😊
"Well, I do a variation, hot yoga probably. So you’re a good cook? 😕"
"I've heard about hot yoga but never had the chance to try it. I practice Iyengar yoga myself. When it comes to cooking, I'm amazing at it. I'd be delighted to cook for you and let you be the judge. 😊"
"I find cooking for me amazing food is the sexiest thing, and definitely the way to my heart. And other places too 😜"
Most definitely
I’ll let you know if you let me ruin your sex life
Are you that bad? Because I want to be the good in your life.
Only if you’re offering to fix me up with your heart.

How about me and you at the cafe?
I’d say that you're the best café ever.
"I’d bite sometimes, hope that’s ok. Are you a parking ticket? Because you’ve got FINE written all over you."
"Well, wait in line."

Umm how about starting with a coffee?

"Tonight around 7 if that works for you, how about we grab a drink and see where the night takes us?"
I will pick you up because you didn't seem to be far.
I have a date in the evening.
"To receive a cheesy pickup line, press 1."

"To receive a crude sexual advance, press 3."

What brings you here?
who knows 😂

no. Its Tinder. what is anyone looking for on here?
Good point 😂
Involves multiple strangers riding at the same time and at least one person throws up? 😉 Are you ready for a wild ride?
I do but how do you know if you don't ask?
Well what can I say I'm just psychic and can tell what you're thinking 😜
Damn that's crazy
Wdym?
"I told them all I want for Christmas is you, and they said they got me a mistletoe."
"Oh, they did? Well, if you were a vegetable, you'd be a cute-cumber!"
Said they're gonna have you wrapped and everything right under my tree.
can you ask them to put me in sparkly pink wrapping paper?
What kind of services do you offer that would make my heart skip a beat? 😂

Damn this is a hard one.

I guess you’re in for a treat then!
they are really lonely
lonely
"Well, what are we waiting for then? Let's make some sparks fly!"
hmmmm idk
hopefully I’ll teach you a few things 🥴
it’s good!! how are you?
"Shikamaru, is that you?"

Are you saying that you know the jutsu through which you can control someone else's body and make them do anything?
"No, I have a monster caged inside me."
I wish I was that monster inside you.
Would you rather detect every lie you hear or get away with every lie you tell?
Detect every lie I hear.
"Depends what gets you going…if I tell you my credit score is near perfect, how does that make you feel?"
"Hey there, what's good?"
What did you do when you were high tho? 😂
I slept as usual.
Smoke its Sunday
"I wish I could sweep you off your feet, but I've got several things that I need to do."

Oh good luck with them.
"Thanks, what are your plans for tonight?"
Going out anytime soon?
Gonna stay home
Oh sounds fun


damn that was quick
not the first time you’re gonna be calling me daddy tho. Would you like to make it a regular thing? 😉

Why the fuck was that smooth tho
Tried to make it sound less cheesy 😂
Hahahaha
Very beautiful 💯📸 I pay big moneys. Be my sugar baby to me please 🦋🌊✈️ DM Daddy for interest 😘
"What is my weekly allowance, daddy? 😳"
I just wanted to make you laugh.
"Them yams lookin vibey, can I get a taste?"
No longer interested if there’s no money
"You blondes are all the same, but I’d treat you differently."
Not you stereotyping my people.
What if we go with a good mix of both? Loll.
"So, your brother then? Lol 😊"

Yea
"U tell me, are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
"Ohh don't get it twisted, I'm most definitely trying to get to know your cuteness."
So yes I'm trying to get us acquainted so I can put something in your diary over this festive period.
I'm having a dilemma whether I should reply or not since you like bitter chocolate.
"I accept a bit of sweetness, how about I take you out for dessert? 🍰"
"Sometimes also too much sweetness can be overwhelming, but I bet you're the perfect balance."
"Looks like you have an exotic taste. Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
Don't you think that it tastes better than a normal one?
But still you won't know for sure until you ask me out 😉
Oh I would love to know how it tastes on your lips.

Are you secretly an angel or something? Kinda feels good just knowing you exist out there 😍
How many times a week do you rip off that line?
"Maybe if you had a bit more tact, you'd be able to pick me up."
Gotta at least pretend to say something nice to get your attention.
that was smooth as hell omg???
i loved that
I'm dead.

"Hey, I’m here to submit my Big Spoon application. Are you ready to be my Little Spoon?"
"Name your qualifications, Kanye."
"I bet it wanted to tie you up in its web, so that it can eat you up. 🕷️👀"

"Texting is great, but nothing beats the real thing. Get closer by replying with a Voice Note."

"if ur right leg is saturn and ur left leg is neptune, would u be my universe?"
Can I visit Uranus?
Yea
Do anything exciting today?
So if I walk by you with a belt on you're gonna have to pat me down and ask me to take it off? 😉
I’m actually going to a Halloween party today. I’m going as a black cat.
Without me by your side? 😉 How will you ever find your way?
I think we would be the hottest couple out there. How about we prove it together?
Yeah I don’t play all that I’m 40yrs old.

Guess this means we are dating now.
Haha


"Goooood, just chillin' enjoying the rain after work 😭"
Nice

What are you looking for here? Or just curious?
"I thought my message was gonna work 😅 Here’s another try, lol!"
"Anybody can drive in a straight line.. It takes a real driver to handle the curves, how about we take a ride together? 😏"
Lol hey
I see you still trying to figure it out... What do you want to figure out about me?
you
Can I paint your face like Picasso?
"Can I tie it into a twizzler, or are you just gonna make me twist in the wind?"
I mean debatable to some but I'll just fuck you either way.
"I have asthma, but I'd love to take your breath away."
I want it to kill me.

"Besides, it gives me time to keep the other girls happy."

You could be the Bonnie to my Clyde 😏

Are you a good shooter? Because you just shot your way into my heart. Lol
let's become enemies
"Nice to meet you Meg! Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
Let's make it happen then.
Is your dog single? Because I’d love to be your pup's human.
You matched with Jade.
Oh wow! I’m guessing he is! Can you tell him I’m stoked!
Your dog's very cute.
"Well, now that’s over, how about we grab a drink together?"
I want more of your love.
"That's a bit salty, but I'll still make you laugh!"
Time for dessert? 🍰
You had quite a few! Haha all good ones
Do you have any raisins? How about a date?
"Don’t speak with your mouth full, unless you’re about to say something really interesting."
"“Once it’s in your mouth, you swallow it.”"
"If you wanna be friends, you gotta be nice!"

Spot on!
"That's a really short one, but I bet you still got great taste. 👍"
"Simple, short, but ohh so descriptive, huh? 😄"
Hahaha right
Now you do one.
If it’s in your mouth you swallow it.

i forgot what i said
Hey there! What have you been up to?
you’d never have the chance to find out if I was your type.
my roommates closet 😊
Challenge accepted😏
i’ll steal your heart 😊
"Pick you up, maybe give you chocolates, go to a nice restaurant, some nice drinks, perhaps some dancing if we're drunk enough, and you feel tired walking in your heels, so I end up holding your things for you while we walk and you have ice cream to end the day."
"Hmmmm... This is supposed to tempt me, right?"
"Oh? Don't like the nice guy package? If you wanted a nice guy, you should have ordered from Amazon."
Can I interest you in something else then?
Depends on what that something else is.
i am diagnosed with a serious case of wanting to know your name.
"Ah lol, what kind of pickup line do you want?"
"How far on the spectrum are you? I mean, haha."
"i’m very very far away from being a complete loser, but I’m also very close to being your favorite mistake."
"Don't worry, I'll carry a pocket sanitizer so we can get dirty together."
Or we don't eat at all.
You have 23 hours to reply.

"Here, take my rose 🌹"
I definitely needed to see a doctor because you just took my breath away.
"Sorry, in my free time I am not working as a doctor 😜😄"
"Hii, do you ever get mad when you're hungry and look in the snack drawer and realize you're the only snack in the house? Because I want to be the only snack you crave."

I gotta put air in my tires first but I’m totally down to do a bike ride with you and just see if we vibe.
"If you don’t got a bike, then you can climb on my handlebars."
Down for an LSD ride anytime ;)
Handlebars sound extremely fun and mildly dangerous.
"I have my own bike with air in the tires. Believe it or not, are you ready to ride into the sunset with me?"
"Apparently, you have wounded me with your eyes and killer smile."
Oh no! I’m kryptonite. I forgot to tell you I can make you weak in the knees!
Are you okay? What did the Dr. say?
Hmmm 🤔

"Hahaha, as long as that hotrod mobility chair has lights and a kick ass sound system, it sounds like it could be a good time!"
"Oh for sure, you know me, I go hard in the taint! Catch me rollin' down yo sidewalk in a blinged out mobility chair, thumpin' some Texas chopped and screwed heavies!"

Face is buried between the pages of a book most days.
I get way too competitive playing fps.
"Love to cook, but I also love to serve you."
People with a sense of humour are a must!
Not dtf.
"Wow you’re hot, wanna ruin my life?"

"Props to the sobriety, by the way."
"Lol that was pretty good, I'll give you that."

"haha cute, I've never heard that one before."



"You go first, so I can get away."
"I'm a flight attendant, so we probably matched while I was in the air."

"Oh god...what's that? Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
"respectfully, i think you and i could make some cute ass babies..."
Are you tryna test my theory out?
"I walked into that face first, lmao. Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."

"Yes please, king."

"Because you took my breath away, I must be a magician."
"I was hoping if I said who, you would not have finished the joke."
I was committed to our love!
"I see that you're from a galaxy far, far away, because your beauty is out of this world."
"You gotta be honest, it was kind of good looking."
It was horrible but I’ll give you credit for even saying that joke
probably
Bit of an archaic classification for a whole ass human being if you ask me.
"I wanted to see what your dirty mind was like and you delivered, lol."

Slugma nuts
Hahaha I’m very sorry!
This is a view I could get used to.
"Good, because I always look like this. Blank stare and Aperol spritz included."
"Being stuck in a room with a comedian that laughs at their own jokes lol is like being trapped in a never-ending stand-up special, and I'm the butt of every punchline."


Are the jokes funny at least?

We gotta put that to the test.
And I'll be the judge if that looks good enough for me to take you out.
Thank you 😳
Be better if they were looking back up at me though.
"I don’t gaslight, you’re just crazy."
Damn I’m so crazy to think you would ever gaslight me🥲 what can I do to make it up to you?

"You're a naughty girl, aren't you?"
you're gonna send me your snap rn and show me what a naughty girl you can be


turn the AC down to 60 and use your thighs as earmuffs.
I love that smile of yours.
That was too cute lol
"What's the catch? Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
"I'm high maintenance, so I'm told, but I'm worth it."
"Mal sehen, was passiert."

"Du bist wie ein Anime, denn du bringst schlechten Humor auf ein ganz neues Level."
Ayy

Yea. I think we'd look good together.
"Yk what this prob isn't gonna go anywhere and I wasn't gonna respond but that was rly good. Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears."
"I'm not a snack, I'm a meal."
Damn so I can pick you up guilt free then. Works for me.


And yet I’m still not even close to top 100...
"I just checked mine and it said check out your top pick hottest single, Deborah."
You're #1 on my list.
Hit list huh?!? That could go either direction!
You tell me where to go and I'll follow you anywhere!
Preferably the direction that I don’t end up on the back of a milk carton. If they still did that kind of thing.
"Idk if they do, lol."
Lol don’t be sorry! I laughed.
I couldn’t help myself. Sorry!!!


"my therapist told me I need to find something to make me happy... so here I am, are you my something?"
