# 🥑 Avottraction - Codeology Sp25

Avottraction is a specialized machine learning model built to evaluate and quantify “attraction” or “RIZZZZZZ” levels in text. By analyzing user-provided content—such as social media posts, chat messages, and more—Avottraction generates an “Avottraction Score” to classify how strongly the text resonates on an attraction scale. Whether you’re curious about the charm of a witty tweet, the allure of a personal message, or the magnetism of brand copy, Avottraction leverages NLP techniques to deliver insights into what makes certain text catch our interest more than others.

  <summary>Cloning and Repo Setup</summary>
  <br>

1. Create a new repo on GitHub

2. Clone our skeleton code to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <PROJECT URL HERE>
   ```

3. Set the remote origin to be YOUR newly created repo (this is so you can make commits to your own repo on GitHub):

   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin <your newly made GitHub repo url>
   ```

4. Set the remote “start origin” to be OUR skeleton code repo (this is so you can get updates to our starter code):

   ```bash
   git remote add starter <PROJECT URL HERE>
   ```

5. Now you can get the latest starter code with the following command:

   ```bash
   git pull starter main
   ```

6. Send Vivek and Heidy the link to your repo via Messenger or iMessage
