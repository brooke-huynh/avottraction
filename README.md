# 🥑 Avottraction - Codeology Sp25

Avottraction is a specialized machine learning model built to evaluate and quantify “attraction” or “RIZZZZZZ” levels in text. By analyzing user-provided content—such as social media posts, chat messages, and more—Avottraction generates an “Avottraction Score” to classify how strongly the text resonates on an attraction scale. Whether you’re curious about the charm of a witty tweet, the allure of a personal message, or the magnetism of brand copy, Avottraction leverages NLP techniques to deliver insights into what makes certain text catch our interest more than others.
